Project Overview



Project Name:

Great Outdoors – Pacific Northwest Adventure Website



Project Description:

The “Great Outdoors” project aims to design and develop a web-based platform that allows users to explore and share outdoor experiences in the Pacific Northwest. The site will include hiking routes, kayaking spots, and camping locations, featuring photos, difficulty ratings, and travel details such as ferry schedules.

The website will also support user engagement through blogs or comment sections and may include premium features like memberships or guided tours in the future. The project aligns with the client’s vision of promoting outdoor exploration while maintaining a user-friendly, natural, and inviting design.
