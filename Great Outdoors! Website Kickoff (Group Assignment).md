Introduction
Hi! My name is Huy, and I’m a member of Group 6. I’ll be representing my group to conduct this interview. The purpose of this interview is to gather information about the client’s requirements for the project. The interview will take around 4–5 minutes, and please be assured that all the information provided will be kept strictly confidential.

Project Overview
Could you please tell me a bit about your business or organization?
The client’s "business" is currently a personal project, not a formal organization, involving three people: the client, funding the project; a friend managing the site; and another friend collaborating on hikes. The focus is sharing outdoor experiences in the Pacific Northwest, such as hiking, kayaking, car camping, and backpacking, with potential plans to monetize it later through memberships or guided tours.
What is the primary goal of your website?
The primary goal of the client’s website is information sharing, specifically to share his outdoor experiences in the Pacific Northwest with friends and family, providing details like how to get to locations, ferry schedules, hike ratings, difficulty levels, and optimal times to visit. The client also has an interest in potentially monetizing the site through memberships or guided tours in the future.
Who is your target audience?
Initially, the client’s target audience is friends and family. He also aims to reach people interested in visiting the Pacific Northwest, particularly those passionate about outdoor activities like hiking, kayaking, and camping, who could use the site as a resource to plan trips and join a community of like-minded individuals.

Design Preferences
Do you have any existing brand guidelines?
The client mentioned a preliminary website called "Great Outdoors" in his repository, which could serve as a starting point for content or design. However, no specific brand guidelines (e.g., logos, color schemes, or fonts) were mentioned, suggesting flexibility in establishing a brand identity.
Are there any websites you admire? What do you like about them?
The client hasn’t identified specific websites he admires, as the idea stemmed from personal sharing rather than existing models. He expressed interest in having his team suggest websites that might align with his vision for inspiration.
Are there any websites you dislike or would like to avoid? Why?
The client hasn’t visited or identified any specific websites he dislikes or wishes to avoid, as the project idea is driven by personal experiences rather than comparisons to other sites.
What kind of visual style are you aiming for?
While the client didn’t specify a visual style, the theme of the "Great Outdoors" and Pacific Northwest suggests a style that could be natural, inviting, or adventure-focused, possibly incorporating imagery of landscapes, forests, or outdoor activities. A clean and user-friendly design might align with his goal of accessibility for friends and a broader audience.

Functionality & Features
What specific features would you like on your website?
The client mentioned the following desired features:
Login feature: To differentiate access levels, allowing friends to access certain content and potential members to access premium content if monetized.
Blog or comment section: To enable friends and users to share experiences, communicate, and build a community, similar to a small-scale social media platform.
Information on locations: Details on how to get to outdoor sites, including ferry schedules, hike difficulty, ratings, and best times to visit.
Media gallery: Ability to upload and display pictures from his outdoor experiences.
Potential job board: For vetted guides, as suggested by a team member, to support monetization.
Do you need any integrations?
The client expressed interest in:
Google Maps or similar: To provide location-based information like directions or ferry schedules.
Weather services: To show weather conditions for hikes or outdoor activities.
Licensing links: Connections to services like Washington licensing for permits, if needed.
Social media integration: For users to share hike photos or experiences tied to the site. However, he noted that CRM or email marketing systems are a long-term goal due to budget constraints, and payment systems are not a priority unless monetization becomes viable.
Do you require multi-language support?
Yes, the client would like the website to primarily be in English but with the ability to translate to other languages as a cool feature to broaden accessibility.
Are there any accessibility requirements you’d like us to consider?
The client didn’t mention specific accessibility requirements, but as experts, we’d recommend considering WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) standards, such as screen reader compatibility, keyboard navigation, and high-contrast visuals, to ensure inclusivity for all users, especially since his audience may grow beyond friends and family.

Content
Do you already have content for the website (text, images, videos)?
The client has pictures from his outdoor experiences and a preliminary website in his repository with some content. He didn’t mention videos or detailed text content, suggesting most content is image-based or needs to be developed.
Will you need help creating or editing content?
The client would like the ability to add pictures himself or have his friend managing the site do so easily. He didn’t explicitly request help with content creation, but given the preliminary nature of the site, assistance with structuring text (e.g., hike descriptions, ratings) or optimizing images might be beneficial.
Who will be responsible for maintaining and updating the website’s content?
The client’s friend managing the site will handle content updates and maintenance, with the client potentially adding pictures himself.

Technical Requirements
Do you have a preferred platform or CMS?
The client specifically requested Python with Flask as the framework, as his friend managing the site prefers it. Flask’s built-in small database is sufficient, as he doesn’t foresee the site being very large initially. No other CMS (e.g., WordPress) was mentioned.
Will you need web hosting services?
Yes, the client wants the site hosted in the cloud (not on a local computer), and he’s open to vendors like AWS, Azure, or others, with no strong preference as long as it meets his needs and budget.
Are there any specific security or privacy concerns we should be aware of?
The client mentioned wanting some content to be confidential for friends only, requiring a login feature to restrict access. No other specific security concerns were noted, but as experts, we’d recommend standard practices like HTTPS, secure authentication, and compliance with data privacy laws (e.g., GDPR if targeting international users) given the potential for multi-language support.

Budget & Timeline
What is your estimated budget for this project?
The client estimated a budget of $3,000 for development and a monthly hosting cost of up to $200. He acknowledged being new to this and is open to feedback if these figures are unrealistic.
Do you have a target launch date for the website?
The client wants the website to go live by December 17th, acknowledging it may not be perfect but should be functional for friends and family to use.
Are there any key milestones or events the website needs to align with?
No specific milestones or events were mentioned beyond the December 17th launch date.

Ongoing Maintenance & Support
Will you need ongoing support and maintenance after the website launch?
The client’s friend will handle basic upkeep and content updates, but he didn’t specify needing external support. However, given his limited technical familiarity, some initial support for troubleshooting or training might be helpful.
Who will handle updates or troubleshooting post-launch?
The client’s friend managing the site will primarily handle updates and troubleshooting, with the client contributing content like pictures.

Final Thoughts
Is there anything else we should know about your business or website needs?
The client is open to future monetization ideas (e.g., memberships, job boards for guides, or affiliate links for licenses/ferries) but wants to keep costs low initially. The project is a passion-driven initiative to share his love for the Pacific Northwest, with potential to grow into a community platform. He’s also open to exploring a mobile app but is concerned about costs, so research into feasibility would be appreciated.
Do you have any concerns or challenges you’d like to discuss?
The client’s main concerns include:
Budget constraints: Ensuring the project stays within $3,000 for development and $200/month for hosting.
Technical unfamiliarity: He’s not well-versed in technology (e.g., hosting or hardware), so clear guidance and simple solutions are preferred.
Scope creep: His requirements are somewhat vague, and he’s relying on the team to propose a clear roadmap for features and future improvements.

Closing
Thank you very much for your time and for sharing this information. After this interview, our team will review the client’s input and prepare a proposal based on his requirements.
